            %li Find the blocks in your neighborhood that are getting cleaned.
            %li Find the blocks that need help.
            %li If your block is being neglected, you can adopt that block. 
            %li Adopting a block only requires about 20 minutes of work per week. 
            %li Group cleans can be organized around blocks in need of extra help.
